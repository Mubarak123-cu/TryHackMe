# Phishing Unfolding — TryHackMe Lab Report

## Project Summary
This repository contains the forensic/reporting work I completed for the **"Phishing Unfolding"** lab on TryHackMe.  
I investigated all alerts generated during the exercise and produced a consolidated **PDF report** with findings, analysis, and recommendations. The PDF is uploaded in this repository.

## What I Did
- Completed the **Phishing Unfolding** lab on TryHackMe.
- Collected and reviewed all security alerts and related artifacts.
- Performed triage and forensic analysis on alerts (timeline, entities, evidence).
- Compiled a professional **PDF report** covering:
  - Incident timeline and key events  
  - Alert-by-alert analysis and classification (TP / FP / missing details)  
  - Evidence and artifacts examined  
  - Root cause hypotheses and attack flow  
  - Mitigations and recommendations  

## Repository Contents
